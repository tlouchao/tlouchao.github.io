## Bio ##

Hey there! I am a software engineer with previous work experience as a freelance
animator for my alma mater, and with local companies in my area. I've recently built 
out this website in order to consolidate [personal projects](/projects), useful [resources](#resources), and [experiments with digital content creation tools](/blog) into one location.

Currently, I'm interested in leveraging a combined engineering & visual arts skillset to land a technical role in, or adjacent to, the entertainment industry. I've tinkered with software packages such as **Autodesk Maya** and **Unreal Engine 5** after venturing into the 3D asset creation / tech art space, with a leg up from completing some coursework with a few talented instructors:

- **Become a Technical Artist** with Aaron Aikman ([ELVTR](https://elvtr.com/))
- **Introduction to 3D with Maya** with James Schaub ([Gnomon School of Visual Effects](https://www.gnomon.edu/))
 
Additionally, I've taken the time to lean into traditional sketching and illustration classes, primarily at [Concept Design Academy](http://www.conceptdesignacad.com/) in Pasadena, California, as well as at [CG Master Academy](https://www.cgmasteracademy.com/). Notable classes are listed below: 

#### CDA (Concept Design Academy) ####
- **Dynamic Sketching** with Peter Han
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Head and Hands Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Character Design for Games** with Alex Chen

#### CGMA ####
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Christian Nacorda
- **Animal Drawing** with Shannon Beaumont
