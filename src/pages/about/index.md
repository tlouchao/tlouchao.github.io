## Bio ##

I am currently working as a software engineer, and have formerly worked as a freelance animator - I've built out this website to document [personal projects](/blog), to bookmark useful [resources](#resources), and to carve out an online space for future notes. As of recent, I've been on the lookout for avenues to incorporate a technical background, as well as a longtime interest in CG art, into my next undertaking.

## Coursework ##

I've ventured into the 3D asset creation / tech art space in the wake of completing the following courses:

- **Become a Technical Artist** with Aaron Aikman ([ELVTR](https://elvtr.com/))
- **Introduction to 3D with Maya** with James Schaub ([Gnomon School of Visual Effects](https://www.gnomon.edu/))
 
I've also leaned into traditional sketching and illustration classes, primarily at [Concept Design Academy](http://www.conceptdesignacad.com/) in the Los Angeles vicinity, as well as at CG Master Academy:

#### CDA ####
- **Dynamic Sketching** with Peter Han
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Head and Hands Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Character Design for Games** with Alex Chen

#### CGMA ####
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Christian Nacorda
- **Animal Drawing** with Shannon Beaumont

## Resources ##

I intend to keep links to helpful resources here, with plans to move these resources to a separate webpage after passing some threshold:

- Vectors and Matrices - https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra
- Blender Python API - https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html
- Python in Maya - https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=__CommandsPython_index_html
