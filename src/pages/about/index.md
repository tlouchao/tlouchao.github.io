## Bio ##

Hey there! - I am a software engineer with previous work experience as a freelance
animator for my alma mater, and for local companies in my area. I've built out this website 
in order to consolidate [personal projects](/projects), useful [resources](#resources), and 
[experiments with digital content creation tools](/blog) into one location.

As of this time, I am interested in bringing a visual arts & computer programming skillset to a technical role in, or adjacent to, the entertainment industry. I have spent time with software packages such as **Autodesk Maya** and **Unreal Engine 5** after venturing into the 3D asset creation / tech art space, in the wake of completing the following coursework:

- **Become a Technical Artist** with Aaron Aikman ([ELVTR](https://elvtr.com/))
- **Introduction to 3D with Maya** with James Schaub ([Gnomon School of Visual Effects](https://www.gnomon.edu/))
 
Previously, I have also leaned into traditional sketching and illustration classes, primarily at [Concept Design Academy](http://www.conceptdesignacad.com/) in the Los Angeles vicinity, as well as at [CG Master Academy](https://www.cgmasteracademy.com/):

#### CDA ####
- **Dynamic Sketching** with Peter Han
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Head and Hands Drawing** with Kevin Chen
- **Character Design for Games** with Alex Chen

#### CGMA ####
- **Analytical Figure Drawing** with Christian Nacorda
- **Animal Drawing** with Shannon Beaumont

## Resources ##

I intend to keep links to helpful resources here, with plans to move these resources to a separate webpage after passing some threshold:

- Vectors and Matrices: https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra
- Blender Python API: https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html
- Python in Maya: https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=__CommandsPython_index_html
- Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine: https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp
