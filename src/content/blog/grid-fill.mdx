## Background ##
I built a grid fill utility for Autodesk Maya, after learning that the option was not readily available by default. 

To provide some context, I had recently tried out 3D modeling with Autodesk Maya over at [Gnomon](https://www.gnomon.edu/) Online, and had caught on 
that having MEL/Python scripts on hand, such as a [hard edge script](https://www.playcreative.io/blog/automatic-hard-edge-script-in-maya) for beveling edges, 
or a script to [generate leaves along the vertices of a surface](https://animprops.com/product/leaves-script/), made the tasks delegated to a modeler **much** easier
to complete. I had blocked out some cylindrical furniture and props in 3D (bottles, table legs, lamps ... et cetera), and wanted to find out if a grid fill option -
similar to that [found in Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/face/grid_fill.html) - was available for use in Maya.

<br/>

I soon found that Maya 2025 did *not* have this functionality built in (as of yet). Therefore, a 3D artist would have the following options to quad fill a
polygon face with a large number of surrounding edges:
    1. Find an existing script somewhere on the Internet in order to extend Maya's capabilities
    2. Bug someone, such as a colleague, to write the script
    3. Resort to writing the script themselves

If all else failed, then a 3D artist was to fall back on something such as the [Multi-Cut Tool](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-93324AE7-5B19-4D74-B41B-74934B4AD20C)
to manually complete such a task.
