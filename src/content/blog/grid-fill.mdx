# Background
I built a grid fill utility for Autodesk Maya, after learning that the option was not available by default. 

I had tried out 3D modeling using Autodesk Maya at [Gnomon](https://www.gnomon.edu/) Online, and came to appreciate having a few [MEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Embedded_Language)/Python scripts on hand, 
such as a [hard edge script](https://www.playcreative.io/blog/automatic-hard-edge-script-in-maya) for beveling edges, or a script to 
[generate leaves along the vertices of a surface](https://animprops.com/product/leaves-script/), in order to make repetitive modeling tasks easier
to complete. After blocking out some cylindrical props in 3D (bottles, table legs, lamps ... et cetera), I wanted to find out if a grid fill function,
similar to that found [in Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/face/grid_fill.html), was available for use in Maya. 

I was previously aware of this [document](https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/mod_notes.html) (with credits to [Pixar](https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/mod_notes.html)) 
which provided some modeling tips when working with the [Catmull-Clark subdivision surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface) modifer. The document mentions that 
placing a *high valence vertex*, or a vertex connected to more than 4 adjacent edges, should be avoided in case a problem occurs in which "wavy" surfaces are produced with the modifier active:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/subdiv_cylinder.png"} alt={"Subdivision Wavy Surface"} width={600} caption={"Subdivision surface modifier applied to a vertex surrounded by triangles."}/>

Instead, circular shapes and cylinder caps should be modeled using quad-based topology:

<br/>

I eventually found that Maya did not have this functionality built in (as of yet). It seemed to me that a 3D artist who needed to split a large number of 
n-gon faces into quads, would have to go with one of the following options to replicate Blender's grid fill functionality:
    1. Find an existing script to extend Maya's capabilities and fill the n-gon faces
    2. Find a colleague to write the script, or write the script themselves
    3. Simply complete the task by hand

Normally, a 3D artist could use the [Multi-Cut Tool](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-93324AE7-5B19-4D74-B41B-74934B4AD20C)
to manually cut edges into an n-gon face.  

# Research

I looked for existing grid fill scripts for Maya, and found a [Quad Fill Hole script](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/dRAM/maya-gn-quad-fill-hole) published by Gabriel Nadeau on the ArtStation marketplace.
From the [demo](https://polycount.com/discussion/216450/maya-gn-quad-fill-hole) and [documentation](https://gabrielnadeau.com/pages/gn-quadfillhole), I saw that the script enabled the quad fill operation by default, 
and provided alternate actions such as the standard fill hole operation (in case the quad fill operation could not be fulfilled). 

Additionally, the script provided the option to add an inset around the hole, which made future operations on the outer edge (edge loop selection, beveling) easier to complete. 
The width and direction of the inset could also be adjusted.

## Grid Fill in Blender

I tested out the grid fill option in Blender, and found that adjusting the **span** changed the number of divisions along the grid fill. Additionally, adjusting the **offset** changed the 
starting position and angle of the grid fill:
<br/>

<br/>

## Maya Python API

I bookmarked the official homepage for the [Maya API](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=__CommandsPython_index_html), as well as the following sites:
    - Maya: MEL & API by Bryan Ewert https://danielfaust.github.io/ewertb/maya.html


I opened the Script Editor to test out a few key commands in MEL ([Maya Embedded Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Embedded_Language)) and in Python, to list the currently selected object(s) in the scene:

**MEL**
```
ls -selection;
```
**Python**
``` python
from maya import cmds
cmds.ls(selection=True)
```
With the [Maya devkit for Windows](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=Maya_SDK_Setting_up_your_build_Windows_environment_64_bit_html), I navigated to the `devkit\pythonScripts`
subdirectory to try out the example scripts included with the devkit. For example, the `createNodeUI.py` script, which relies on a
`createNode.ui` file in the same directory, opens a [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) dialog when executed, and allows a user to create a named node at the scene origin:

<br/>


# Implementation

I decided to implement the core grid fill functionality first, before introducing a GUI later down the line.

First, I created a cylinder primitive with an even number of edges and completed the grid fill process by hand. I kept Maya's Script Editor
open and took note of the MEL commands printed to the history pane per operation. 

Note that the MEL commands listed in the table below should be interpreted as Python-like format strings 
(variable names between `{` and `}` should be replaced with object names):

| Operation | MEL | Additional Notes
|---|---|---|
| Click on a polygon edge | [`select`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/select.html) `{objNode}.e[{id}];` | <ul><li>`objNode` is the cylinder *transform* node</li><li>`id` is the edge component ID</li></ul>
| Double click on edge to select edge loop | `select -add {objNode}.e[{id}];` | Add to existing selection
| Fill hole | [`polyCloseBorder`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/polyCloseBorder.html)`;` |
| Select Multi-Cut tool | `MultiCutTool;` | 
| Create new edge | [`polySplit`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/polySplit.html) `-ep {e1} 1 -ep {e2} 1` |  <ul><li>`e1` is the first edge component ID</li><li>`e2` is the second edge component ID</li></ul>

<br></br>

## Core Functionality

From testing out the edge loop selection on cylinder primitives, I found that the edge/vertex component indices were returned in ascending order, 
and happened to be *consecutive*:

``` python
from maya import cmds
sl = cmds.ls(selection=True, flatten=True)
# Result: [objNode.e[0], objNode.e[1]. objNode.e[2] ... ]
```
``` python
v = cmds.polyListComponentConversion(sl, toVertex=True)
cmds.select(v)
slv = cmds.ls(selection=True, flatten=True)
# Result: [objNode.vtx[0], objNode.vtx[1]. objNode.vtx[2] ... ]
```

Since the edge/vertex indices were consecutive, I assumed that the vertex at the **start** of the list (*lowest index*), followed by 
the vertex in the **middle** of the list (*number of selected edges divided by 2*), would make up the endpoints of an edge that bisected/roughly bisected 
the n-gon face:
``` python
sledge = cmds.polyEvaluate(sl[0], edgeComponent=True)
```
``` python
i = 0
j = sledge // 2
```
``` python
cmds.polyConnectComponents(f'{objNode}.vtx[{i}]', f'{objNode}.vtx[{j}]')
```
<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/implement1.png"} alt={"Poly Connect Components"} width={500} caption={"Connect two vertices. Component IDs (vertices) are displayed."}/>
<br/>

### Adding the Offset

Adding some number, or the **offset**, to both the starting endpoint `i` and opposite endpoint `j`, would rotate the edge by that number:

``` python
def getIdx(idx, n):
    ret = idx
    if idx < 0:
        ret = (n + idx) % n # wrap around
    elif idx >= n:
        ret = idx % n # wrap around
    return ret
```
``` python
i = getIdx(0 + offset, sledge)
j = getIdx((sledge // 2) + offset, sledge)
```

To create the edges on either side of the bisecting edge, I saw two ways to get the adjacent endpoints:
    1. **Increase** the starting index `i` by one, and **decrease** the opposite index `j` by one
    2. **Decrease** the starting index `i` by one, and **increase** the opposite index `j` by one

``` python
i = getIdx(i + 1, sledge)
j = getIdx(j - 1, sledge)
```
``` python
cmds.polyConnectComponents(f'{objNode}.vtx[{i}]', f'{objNode}.vtx[{j}]')
```

<br/>

### Determining the Span

I needed to find a cutoff point for creating edges on either side of the bisecting edge, as adding/subtracting from the starting and opposite indices `i` and `j` 
would lead to an out of bounds error (where the upper bound was equal to the total number of selected edges). 

I found that if I wanted a roughly equal number of **rows** and **columns** in the grid, I could set the upper limit for the number of **rows** to the number of selected edges in the edge loop, divided by four.
The same upper limit could also be applied to the **columns**.

The number of corner vertices, or the vertices between the **rows** and **columns**, would need to be subtracted from the number of selected edges to maintain the final quad topology of the cylinder cap.

The existing edges (**rows**) would be subdivided to provide vertices for future `polySplit` / `polyConnectComponents` operations to connect to (**columns**). 
In the following image, the new edges (**columns**) are labeled in blue, and the corner vertices (to exclude) are labeled in red:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/implement2a.png"} alt={"Setup Perpendicular Edges"} width={500} caption={""}/>
<br/>

With these rules in mind, I set the `span`, as well as the `rows` (# of rows) and `cols` (# of columns) to the following:

``` python
span = sledge // 4
rows = span if span % 2 == 1 else span - 1
cols = sledge // 2 - rows - 2
```

### Iterating over Rows

I subdivided the existing edges (**rows**) by the number of **columns** using `polySubdivideEdge`, and looped over the number of **rows** 
to connect the starting and opposite vertices using `polyConnectComponents`:

``` python
rowBeginEdge = cmds.polyEvaluate(sl[0], edge=True)
```
``` python
i = getIdx(i - ((span - 1) // 2), sledge)
j = getIdx(j + ((span - 1) // 2), sledge)
k = rowBeginEdge
ii = i # save begin index
```
``` python
p = 0
while p < rows:
    # create edge
    cmds.polyConnectComponents(f'{objNode}.vtx[{i}]', f'{objNode}.vtx[{j}]')
    # subdivide edge
    cmds.select(f'{objNode}.e[{k}]')
    cmds.polySubdivideEdge(divisions=cols)
    # increment
    p += 1
    if p != rows:
        i = getIdx(i + 1, sledge)
        j = getIdx(j - 1, sledge)
        k += cols + 1
```

### Iterating over Columns
With the intermediate vertices in place, I created the edges (**columns**) perpendicular to the initial bisecting edge. For the starting and opposite **column** vertices,
I offset the outermost **row** vertices by two to exclude the corners:

``` python
colBeginEdge = cmds.polyEvaluate(sl[0], edge=True)
```
``` python
i = getIdx(i + 2, sledge)
j = getIdx(ii - 2, sledge)
k = rowBeginEdge + 1
```
``` python
q = 0
while q < cols:
    d = k
    # loop from j to i
    orig = j; dest = d
    for _ in range(rows):
        # create edge
        cmds.polyConnectComponents(f'{objNode}.vtx[{orig}]', f'{objNode}.vtx[{dest}]')
        d += cols + 1
        orig = dest; dest = d
    # create the last edge
    cmds.polyConnectComponents(f'{objNode}.vtx[{orig}]', f'{objNode}.vtx[{i}]')
    # increment
    q += 1 
    if q != cols:
        i = getIdx(i + 1, sledge)
        j = getIdx(j - 1, sledge)
        k += 1
```

### Adjust Edge Flow  

Finally, I edited the [edge flow](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-190E49D9-0D04-4F55-A54A-285A85258DD4) of the newly
created edges, to even out the distribution:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/implement4.png"} alt={"Adjust Edge Flow"} width={500} caption={""}/>
<br/>

## Validation

I revisited the start of the script to add a few safeguards. To exit the script early, given no selection at all:

``` python
errStr = "Please select an edge loop."
...
if not sl:
    cmds.error("Nothing selected. " + errStr)
```
To check that the selected object corresponded to a polygon mesh:
``` python
if not cmds.objectType(sl[0], isType="mesh"):
    typeErrStr = f"Type \"{cmds.objectType(sl[0])}\" selected. "
    cmds.error(typeErrStr + errStr)
```
And to check for an even number of selected edges:
``` python
if (sledge % 2 == 1):
    cmds.warning("Please select an even number of edges.")
```

## Adding the Inset

For the inset, I relied on the [`polyExtrudeEdge`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/CHS/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/polyExtrudeEdge.html) command - 
I matched the **Local Translate Z**, **Offset**, and **Divisions** arguments to those passed to `polyExtrudeEdge`:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/implement5.png"} alt={"Add Inset"} width={600} caption={"Extrude the selected edge loop to add an inset."}/>

``` python
if (doInset):
    cmds.polyExtrudeEdge(*sl, offset=yInset, localTranslateZ=zInset, divisions=divInset)
    sl = cmds.ls(selection=True, flatten=True) # reselect edge loop
```

## Alternate Actions

For the alternate n-gon fill, I simply called the [`polyCloseBorder`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/CHS/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/polyCloseBorder.html) command:

``` python
cmds.polyCloseBorder()
```
If both *grid fill* and *n-gon* options are ignored, then the script simply does not fill the hole. 

# User Interface

Once again, I relied on [Qt Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download) to setup the user interface.

From the [example code in the devkit](/blog/grid-fill/#maya-python-api), I made sure that my `ui` file and Python file were placed in the 
same `scripts` subdirectory, under my project folder. Then, I employed the [QUiLoader](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/quiloader.html) class to create 
the grid fill tool UI at run-time, using the information stored in the `ui` file:

``` python
def initUI(self):

    """Initialize the UI"""

    # load the QT Designer File
    loader = QUiLoader()
    ws = cmds.workspace(q=True, rd=True)
    file = QFile(ws + "/scripts/gridfill.ui")
    file.open(QFile.ReadOnly)

    self.ui = loader.load(file, parentWidget=self)
    file.close()
```
I also added the grid fill tool to a custom shelf for quick access outside of the Script Editor:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/shelf.png"} alt={"Custom Shelf"} width={600} caption={"Tool added to a custom shelf and outlined in green."}/>
<br/>


# Future Work

The return value from an [`ls`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/MayaCRE-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/ls.html) command (selected edge loop) is 
currently a list of selected edges ordered by **component ID ascending**. And so, a selected edge loop with non-consecutive IDs will break the script:

<br/>
<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_10_16_grid_fill/cornerbevel.png"} alt={"Cube with Beveled Edges"} width={700} caption={"A cube with beveled edges. Component IDs are non-consecutive."}/>

A future version of the grid fill tool should reorder the list of selected edges by **adjacency**, with possible help from [`polySelectConstraint`](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2024/CHS/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/polySelectConstraint.html)
and its optional `propagate` argument to grow an existing selection. Then, it should map the index of each edge in the revised list 
of edges, to its underlying edge component ID:

``` python
mapEdges = dict()
```
``` python
# TODO: get the edges ordered by adjacency, and not by component ID
for idx, val in enumerate(orderedEdges):
    mapEdges[idx] = getComponentId(val)
```
