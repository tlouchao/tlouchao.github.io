This blog post covers the remainder of the work that I completed for a [technical art course](https://elvtr.com/course/technical-art)
which ran from February 2024 to April 2024. The previous blog post can be found [here](/blog/batch-renamer). To skip to the 
demo video, click [here](/blog/blender-fbx-exporter/#demo).

## Background ##

As the final weeks approached, I was given the choice of building either a Python tool, an Unreal Engine 5 
[Blueprint](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine), a shader/material, 
or a [Niagara](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-visual-effects-in-niagara-for-unreal-engine) visual effect. 
Since I was familiar with Python, and because I was not yet fully comfortable with Unreal Engine 5, I decided to opt for the Python tool. 

After narrowing down my choices, I was given some suggestions as to what to build, such as an LOD generator, 
or a file log parser, or an FBX settings manager ... et cetera. 

Since I was learning more about Blender at that point in time, I decided to build an **FBX exporter** for Blender 
(in the form of a [Blender Add-on](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.1/editors/preferences/addons.html)), 
with Unreal Engine 5 as the destination for an outbound FBX.

### Unit Conversion ###

One important issue that I wanted to address was the <u>unit system mismatch</u> between Blender and Unreal Engine 5. 
In order for the **FBX exporter** to be effective, it needed to convert between units in addition to exporting 
the actual FBX.

I recalled that the default unit of measurement in Blender (see the [Blender documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/scene/properties.html))
is one meter, assuming that the unit system setting under the Scene Properties tab is set to either "None" or "Metric". I also recalled 
that the default unit of measurement in Unreal Engine 5 is one centimeter, assuming that Unreal's unit system settings remain unchanged (should be metric):

| Software | Unit System | Length Unit
|---|---|---|
|Blender | None (Blender Units), Metric | Meter (apply a **0.01** multiplier to convert to centimeters) 
|Unreal Engine 5 | Metric | Centimeter (the target unit)

<br/>

<h3>Modeling at Scale</h3>

Assuming that Blender's scene length unit has not been changed to centimeters, or assuming that the unit scale has not been changed to **0.01** - 
an asset (such as a coffee mug) from Blender could appear in Unreal Engine at 100 times the intended scale:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/coffee_mug.png"} alt={"Coffee Mug at Scale"} width={800} caption={"Coffee mug imported into Unreal at the correct scale (left) and incorrect scale (right)."} /><br/>

## Requirements ##

I was granted the go-ahead to build my exporter, under the conditions that it was similar in complexity to the [batch renamer](/blog/batch-renamer) 
from the previous assignment, and that it had a GUI with three or more meaningful options for the user to configure.

It was imperative that the exporter could do at least the following:

1. Get a valid filepath for a target folder - to start things out, this could be the `Content\` folder of an Unreal project
2. Append the name of the FBX file to the filepath
3. Export and place the FBX in the target folder

### Meaningful Options ###

A Blender user should be able to:

1. Set a custom FBX filename. If not specified, then the filename should be the `.blend` filename by default
2. Set a valid subdirectory to send the FBX file to. For example, send a `Suzanne.fbx` to the `Mesh\` subdirectory under the `Content\` folder
3. Apply a scale transform to the output FBX. This would be a **0.01** multiplier by default, unless changed
4. Select a **mesh** to export, or an **armature** (for animation), or **both**

Regarding the fourth option, I wanted to support the **mesh** and **armature** object types after looking into a video which covered 
ideal FBX export settings for Unreal Engine 5. The next section goes over these object types [in further detail](/blog/blender-fbx-exporter/#the-built-in-exporter).

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Research ##

I had not written Blender Add-on before, and so did a YouTube search on the topic. I found the following videos to be hugely useful for initial setup:

- Create a Custom Blender Panel with Less Than 50 Lines of Python Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyy_6N3JV3k
- How to Install Addons in Blender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYh1qh9y1MI

I also searched for existing exporters from Blender to Unreal, as the unit system mismatch issue had likely been addressed before.
I was able to find a Blender Add-on named **Send to Unreal** (maintained by Epic Games), as well as a video describing the 
difference between it and the built-in exporter:

- Send to Unreal: https://epicgamesext.github.io/BlenderTools/send2ue
- Send to Unreal VS FBX Export: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y51-tXjKEzc

### Add-on Installation ###

I made sure that I could install and uninstall a Blender Add-on after looking over the first video (credits to Victor Stepanov). With the
[`simple_custom_panel.py`](https://github.com/CGArtPython/blender_plus_python/blob/main/add-ons/simple_custom_panel/simple_custom_panel.py) file,
I navigated to Blender's `Edit > Preferences` menu, clicked on the `Add-ons` section and `Community` tab, and clicked on the "Install" button to open a file browser and find 
the Python file. 

Then, I installed and activated the example Add-on:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/simple_custom_panel.png"} alt={"Simple Custom Panel"} width={800} /><br/>

### Blender Python API ###

Continuing on from the `Edit > Preferences` menu and `Interface` section, I enabled some developer-friendly features such as **User Tooltips** and 
[**Python Tooltips**](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/preferences/interface.html#bpy-types-preferencesview-show-tooltips-python):

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/python_scale_tooltip.png"} alt={"Python Tooltip in Blender"} width={600} caption={'Hovering over the Scale Transform Y attribute of the default cube to view the user tooltip and Python tooltip.'}/><br/>

I made sure that I could access the [scale](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Object.html#bpy.types.Object.scale) attribute listed in the Python tooltip,
by navigating to the [Python console](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/python_console.html) (under Blender's *Scripting* workspace tab), and then
entering the following commands to halve the dimensions of the default cube:

``` python
c = bpy.data.objects['Cube']
c.scale = Vector((0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
```

### The Built-in Exporter ###

I tried out the default exporter to better understand the settings I needed to change for Unreal. I navigated to the `File > Export > FBX` menu to open the built-in dialog, 
and set the target folder to the `Content\` folder of an Unreal Project. Then, I clicked the "Export FBX" button without adjusting the default settings - this caused Unreal to show a warning on FBX import:
```
No smoothing group information was found in this FBX scene.
```

Afterwards, I made a few changes to the export settings (with help from this video which covers [ideal FBX export settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y51-tXjKEzc) 
for Unreal). I checked **Selected Objects**, reduced the list of possible object types to "Mesh" and "Armature", 
and set the Smoothing type to "Face" instead of "Normals Only". These revised settings allowed Unreal to import the default cube without issues:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/selected_objects.png"} alt={"Selected Object Types"} 
width={500} caption={"Adjusted settings for Blender's built-in FBX Exporter."} />

<br/><hr/><br/>

## Implementation ##

First, I needed the Python command which mapped to the export operation as shown above. 
For the [export_scene.fbx](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.export_scene.html) function, 
I determined the list of input arguments which were relevant to the project requirements:

``` python
bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(filepath='', global_scale=1.0, apply_unit_scale=True, apply_scale_options='FBX_SCALE_NONE',
                         use_selection=False, object_types={'ARMATURE', 'CAMERA', 'EMPTY', 'LIGHT', 'MESH', 'OTHER'},
                         mesh_smooth_type='OFF')
```

Following the example [code](https://github.com/CGArtPython/blender_plus_python/blob/main/add-ons/simple_custom_panel/simple_custom_panel.py)
from the first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyy_6N3JV3k), I set up the necessary code to add a [panel](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Panel.html) 
to the sidebar of the 3D viewport. I set up *one* button to execute `export_scene.fbx` when clicked:

``` python
import bpy

bl_info = {
    "name": "Export FBX From Blender to Unreal Engine 5 (.fbx)",
    "category": "Import-Export",
}

class MainPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    
    bl_space_type = "VIEW_3D"
    bl_region_type = "UI"
    bl_category = "Export FBX"
    bl_label = "Export FBX"
    
    def draw(self, context):
        self.layout.operator('export_scene.fbx', text='Run')

def register():
    bpy.utils.register_class(MainPanel)

def unregister():
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(MainPanel)

# Run the script directly from Blender's 
# Text Editor without installing the add-on
if __name__ == "__main__":
    register()
```

I made sure that I could install this Python file as a Blender Add-on, and that the panel was visible. I confirmed that clicking
on the "Run" button opened a dialog for the built-in exporter:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/implement1.png"} alt={"Installed Add-on and Minimal GUI"} width={800} caption={"Installed Add-on and Minimal GUI."}/><br/>

From here, I needed to pass some input arguments, such as the filepath, to `export_scene.fbx`. I determined that I needed a custom 
[operator](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Operator.html) which would appear as a button in the Blender Add-on GUI, and would 
perform additional steps before executing `export_scene.fbx` on click.

### The Export Operator ###

I defined a new subclass of `bpy.types.Operator`, and prepared to override its `execute()` method. I registered my new `Operator` subclass with
Blender, moved the text label into the `bl_label` property, and set a unique `bl_idname` so that my `Panel` subclass would be able to discover it:

``` python
class ExportOperator(bpy.types.Operator):

    '''Export the FBX'''
    bl_idname = "export_scene.custom_fbx"
    bl_label = "Run"
    
    def execute(self, context):
        return {'FINISHED'}
```

``` python
class MainPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    ...
    def draw(self, context):
        self.layout.operator('export_scene.custom_fbx')
```
For the `execute()` method body, I needed to name the FBX after the currently opened Blender file. I extracted the filename 
with the help of [`bpy.data.filepath`](https://docs.blender.org/api/latest/bpy.types.BlendData.html#bpy.types.BlendData.filepath)
and [`bpy.path.basename`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.path.html#bpy.path.basename). Then, I hardcoded a filepath with 
the filename and `.fbx` extension, and sent it to `export_scene.fbx` as its first input argument:

``` python
class ExportOperator(bpy.types.Operator):
    ...
    def execute(self, context):

        bpath = bpy.data.filepath
        [stem, ext] = os.path.splitext(bpy.path.basename(bpath))
        
        filepath = os.path.join('C:\\', 'Unreal Projects', 'MyProject', 'Content', stem + '.fbx')
        bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(filepath=filepath)
        
        self.report({'INFO'}, f"Export {filepath}")
        return {'FINISHED'}
```

### User-Defined Filepath ###

Once the custom operator could be called without issue, I replaced the hardcoded filepath with a user-defined filepath to send to `export_scene.fbx`. 
After learning more about [custom properties](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.props.html) in Blender, I added one 
[`StringProperty`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.StringProperty.html#stringproperty-property) to the current
scene to store a user-defined string value:

``` python
bpy.types.Scene.project_dir = bpy.props.StringProperty(
    name="Project Folder",
    description="Unreal Engine 5 project folder", 
)
```
I added this `StringProperty` to my panel layout in the 3D viewport, which appeared as an edit field in my Blender Add-on GUI:

``` python
placeholder = os.path.join('C:\\', 'Unreal Projects', 'MyProject', 'Content')
self.layout.prop(context.scene, "project_dir", placeholder=placeholder)
```

And replaced the hardcoded filepath with the new value:

``` python
filepath = os.path.join(context.scene.project_dir, stem + '.fbx')
```

#### The File Select Operator ####

Still, I needed some way to open a file browser and assign the selected filepath to the `project_dir` to make the Blender Add-on easier to use. 
I registered a second operator to do this:

``` python
class ProjectPathOperator(bpy.types.Operator):
    
    '''Set the Unreal Engine 5 Project Folder'''
    bl_idname = 'export_scene.project_dir'
    bl_label = "Add"
    
    # select directories
    directory: bpy.props.StringProperty()

    # show only directories
    filter_folder: bpy.props.BoolProperty(
        default=True,
        options={"HIDDEN"}
    )
    
    def invoke(self, context, event):
        context.window_manager.fileselect_add(self)
        return {'RUNNING_MODAL'}
    
    def execute(self, context):
        context.scene.project_dir = self.directory
        return {'FINISHED'}
```

And added this operator to my panel layout in the 3D viewport, which appeared as an clickable button in my Blender Add-on GUI:

``` python
self.layout.operator('export_scene.project_dir')
```

           alts={["Filepath Layout Before",
                  "Filepath Layout After"]}
           caption={"Before and after layout adjustments."}
           width={500}
>
</BlogImage><br/>

#### Subdirectory and Filename ####

I repeated the steps above by adding two additional instances of `StringProperty`, and made sure that the export operator could append a 
subdirectory and filename to the existing filepath. I displayed the subdirectory in particular as a relative path:

``` python
class ProjectSubPathOperator(bpy.types.Operator):
    
    '''Set the Unreal Engine 5 Project Subdirectory'''
    bl_idname = 'export_scene.project_subdir'
    bl_label = "Add"
    ...
    def execute(self, context):

        commonpath = os.path.commonpath(
            [context.scene.project_dir, self.directory]) + os.sep

        # display relative directory
        rel_project_subdir = self.directory.replace(commonpath, '')
        context.scene.project_subdir = rel_project_subdir

        return {'FINISHED'}
```
And updated the panel layout with the new fields:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/implement5.png"} alt={"Panel with Directory and Filename Edit Fields"} width={500}></BlogImage>

<br/><hr/><br/>

### Dynamic Property Group ###

To keep things organized, I moved the `StringProperty` instances into a 
[`PropertyGroup`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.PropertyGroup.html) - I registered my new class, and attached a 
[`PointerProperty`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.PointerProperty.html#pointerproperty-property) to the current scene 
to maintain a reference to the `PropertyGroup`:

``` python
class ExportPropertyGroup(bpy.types.PropertyGroup):
    project_dir: bpy.props.StringProperty(
        name="Project Folder",
        description="Unreal Engine 5 project folder", 
    )
    ...
    # subdirectory and filename properties
```
``` python
def register():
    ...
    bpy.utils.register_class(ExportPropertyGroup)
    bpy.types.Scene.io_ue5_fbx = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type=ExportPropertyGroup)

def unregister():
    ...
    bpy.utils.unregister_class(ExportPropertyGroup)
    del bpy.types.Scene.io_ue5_fbx # cleanup
```

I also made sure to update `StringProperty` access throughout my script, now that the `PropertyGroup` had ownership:

``` python
class ExportOperator(bpy.types.Operator):
    ...
    def execute(self, context):
        io_ue5_fbx = context.scene.io_ue5_fbx
        project_dir = io_ue5_fbx.project_dir
        project_subdir = io_ue5_fbx.project_subdir
        stem = io_ue5_fbx.filename
        ...
        filepath = os.path.join(project_dir, project_subdir, stem + '.fbx')
```
``` python
class MainPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    ...
    def draw(self, context):
        placeholder = os.path.join('C:\\', 'Unreal Projects', 'MyProject', 'Content')
        self.layout.prop(context.scene.io_ue5_fbx, "project_dir", placeholder=placeholder)
        ...
```

### Scale Transform ###

For the scale transform factor, I added a [`FloatProperty`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.FloatProperty.html#floatproperty-property)
to my `PropertyGroup` to hold a numerical value, with **0.01** as the stated default:

``` python
class ExportPropertyGroup(bpy.types.PropertyGroup):
    scale: bpy.props.FloatProperty(
        name="Scale",
        description="Scale Factor",
        precision=2,
        default=0.01,
        soft_min=0,
        soft_max=10,
    )
    ...
    # previously defined properties
```
### Selected Objects ###

For the selected object types, I added two instances of [`BoolProperty`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.BoolProperty.html#boolproperty-property)
to keep track of whether or not to export a **mesh**, an **armature**, or **both**:
``` python
class ExportPropertyGroup(bpy.types.PropertyGroup):
    mesh: bpy.props.BoolProperty(
        name="Mesh",
        description="Export the selected mesh",
        default=False,
    )
    armature: bpy.props.BoolProperty(
        name="Armature",
        description="Export the selected armature",
        default=False,
    )
    ...
    # previously defined properties
```

### Smoothing Type ###

For the smoothing information, I created an [`EnumProperty`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.EnumProperty.html#enumproperty-property) 
to stand in for one of three separate options, and set the default option to "Face":
``` python
class ExportPropertyGroup(bpy.types.PropertyGroup):
    smoothing: bpy.props.EnumProperty(
        name="Smoothing",
        description="Export smoothing information",
        default="FACE",
        items=[
            ("FACE", "Face (Recommended)", "Write face smoothing"),
            ("EDGE", "Edge", "Write edge smoothing"),
            ("OFF", "Normals Only", "Export only normals instead of writing edge or face smoothing data"),
        ],
    )
    ...
    # previously defined properties
```

### Panel Layout ###

I added one more operator to my panel labeled "Reset to Recommended Defaults" to allow users to revert the filename, selected object types, 
scale factor, and smoothing options to their default values. 

Then, I finalized the overall layout by moving properties/operators related to filepath configuration and export settings under a 
"Settings" subpanel, and kept the remaining operators under an "Export" subpanel:

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_22_blender_fbx_exporter/implement6.png"} alt={"Panel and Subpanels"} width={600}></BlogImage><br/>

### Validation ###

To show my Add-on under the conditions that the [selected objects](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/selecting.html) 
in the current scene included at least one **mesh** and/or **armature**, I decided to monitor the state of the selected objects with help from
[`bpy.types.Panel.poll`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.Panel.html#bpy.types.Panel.poll) and 
[`bpy.context.selected_objects`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.context.html#bpy.context.selected_objects):

``` python
class MainPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    ...
    @classmethod
    def poll(cls, context):
        '''
        Decide whether or not to show the tool based on context
        '''
        obj_types = ['MESH', 'ARMATURE']
        found = False

        # check selected objects
        for obj in context.selected_objects
            if (obj.type in obj_types):
                found = True
                break

        return found
    ...
```

I also made sure to enable the "Run" button, given a valid filepath. In all other cases, I decided to 
[grey out](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.types.UILayout.html#bpy.types.UILayout.enabled) the button:

``` python
def update_project_dir(self, context):
    if (not os.path.isdir(self.project_dir)):
        print(f"Invalid filepath: {self.project_dir}")
    
class ExportPropertyGroup(bpy.types.PropertyGroup):
    project_dir: StringProperty(
        name="Project Folder",
        description="Unreal Engine 5 project folder",
        update=update_project_dir
    )
    ...
    # previously defined properties
```
``` python  
class ExportPanel(bpy.types.Panel):
    ...
    def draw(self, context):
        ...
        row = self.layout.row()
        row.operator('export_scene.custom_fbx')
        if (not os.path.isdir(context.scene.io_ue5_fbx.project_dir)):
            row.enabled = False
```

### Export to Unreal ###

Finally, I passed the user-defined arguments from the GUI into Blender's [`export_scene.fbx`](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.export_scene.html):

``` python
class ExportOperator(bpy.types.Operator):
    
    '''Export the FBX'''
    bl_idname = "export_scene.custom_fbx"
    bl_label = "Run"

    def execute(self, context):

        io_ue5_fbx = context.scene.io_ue5_fbx
      
        # filepath ------------------------------------------- #

        project_dir = io_ue5_fbx.project_dir
        project_subdir = io_ue5_fbx.project_subdir

        if (io_ue5_fbx.filename):
            stem = io_ue5_fbx.filename
        else:
            bpath = bpy.data.filepath
            [stem, _] = os.path.splitext(bpy.path.basename(bpath))
        
        filepath = os.path.join(project_dir, project_subdir, stem + '.fbx')
        
        # rest of the settings ------------------------------- #
        
        global_scale = io_ue5_fbx.scale
        apply_unit_scale = True
        apply_scale_options = 'FBX_SCALE_NONE'

        use_selection = True
        object_types = set()
        
        if (io_ue5_fbx.mesh):
            object_types.add('MESH')
        if (io_ue5_fbx.armature):
            object_types.add('ARMATURE')
        
        mesh_smooth_type = io_ue5_fbx.smoothing
        
        # export ---------------------------------------------- #
        
        bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(filepath=filepath,
                                 global_scale=global_scale,
                                 apply_unit_scale=apply_unit_scale,
                                 apply_scale_options=apply_scale_options,
