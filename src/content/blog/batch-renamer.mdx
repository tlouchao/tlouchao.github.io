## Background ##

From February 2024 to April 2024, I had the chance to take a [technical art course through ELVTR](https://elvtr.com/course/technical-art) - 
I had heard that the tech art role required some proficiency in Python programming, in addition to art sensibilities in the case of shaders and VFX. 

Before taking the course, I was acquainted with Python, but not within the context of games. I was also somewhat familiar with Qt and C++, 
but had not yet tried PyQt/Qt for Python.

### Batch Renamer Utility ###

A few weeks into the coursework (from late February to early March), I was given a task - I was to implement a batch renamer utility, 
firstly as a command line script, and later on as a [PyQt6 application](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) built on top of the previous script.

The assignment was meant to introduce a common pain point with game asset management - finding a way to quickly rename hundreds (or thousands) 
of texture exports, 3D renders and configuration files located in a repository somewhere, while retaining some flexibility in configuring said
operation. 

This utility would then be called upon to target files with typos, or files which needed to be moved to some other directory, 
or files in need of an update to a new naming convention ... and so on.

## The Dilemma ##

At the time of taking the course, the utility was expected to do at least the following per rename operation:

1. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-one">Get a valid filepath to the current folder</a>
2. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-two">Get a valid filepath to a target folder</a>   
3. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-three">Select files in the current folder</a>          
4. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-four">Rename the selected files in place, or copy to the target folder</a>

Optionally, the utility could do one or more of the following steps per operation:
- Filter selected files by file extension
- Find and replace one or more substrings in the selected files
- Add a *prefix* and/or *suffix* to the selected files
- Enable overwriting the selected files, if the files already exist in the target folder

Given the following test files, the output files were to be free of noise such as the version number of the file, 
or extraneous words such as "file", "final", et cetera. At the same time, each filename was to be surrounded with short, 
descriptive text indicating the type of game asset that the file represented:
| Initial Filenames | Target |
|---|---|
|texture_metal_diffuse.png | T_metal_C.png
|grass_file_01.ma          | M_grass.ma
|hello_world.txt           | NOTE_hello_world_TEMP.txt

For example, the filename for a diffuse map could have a <mark>"T"</mark> prefix instead of "texture", and a 
<mark>"C"</mark> suffix instead of "diffuse" or "color".

## Tools and Setup ##
[Qt Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download) was introduced early on as a free tool for quickly 
prototyping graphical user interfaces with widgets from the Qt GUI framework (though the possibility remained open to 
build a GUI from scratch). 

A batch file was also provided to help with translating the XML based `.ui` file produced from Qt Designer to an equivalent `.py` file - 
the batch file made use of the `pyuic.py` module included with `PyQt6`, and mapped Qt widget names directly to the data attributes 
of a Python class named `Ui_MainWindow` when run:

``` shell
python -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -x batch_renamer.ui -o batch_renamer_ui.py
```
The resulting output file would be included as a dependency in another Python file, which included some starter code. The example code demonstrated how 
to connect a button click event to an event handler. Or in Qt terms, connecting a `clicked()` [signal](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html) 
to a [slot](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html):

``` python
# Our Qt Designer GUI as a Python class
from batch_renamer_ui import Ui_MainWindow

class BatchRenamerWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):

    def __init__(self):
            # UI Setup
            super().__init__()
            super(Ui_MainWindow).__init__()
            self.setupUi(self)
            # Connect button to a function
            # Make sure that there is a Qt Widget named "browseBtn"
            self.browseBtn.clicked.connect(self.get_filepath)

    def get_filepath(self):
        self.filepath = QFileDialog().getExistingDirectory()
```
This Python file, which contained the class definition for the `BatchRenamerWindow`, would become the primary working file 
over those next couple of weeks.

## Implementation ##

Since I was unfamiliar with Python bindings for Qt beforehand, note that the following details will primarily cover discoveries made while working with PyQt.

### UI Design ###

After prototyping in Qt Designer and converting my `.ui` file to `.py`, I eventually landed on the GUI shown below, which I styled with a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/stylesheet.html" target="_blank">Qt Style Sheet</a> (credits to <a href="https://qss-stock.devsecstudio.com/templates.php" target="_blank">DevSec Studio</a>):

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_01_batch_renamer/batch_renamer_gui.png"} alt={"Batch Renamer Utility GUI"} width={720}/>

Though I had a GUI (nice to look at, but with zero functionality), I still needed to handle user interaction with Qt's edit fields, buttons, and other clickable widgets. 

### Requirements ###

After familiarizing myself with the project files, I extended the starter code and leaned on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank">`os`</a> module for file navigation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path" target="_blank">`os.path`</a> for pathname manipulation, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re" target="_blank">`re`</a> for regular expression matching in tandem with built-in string methods such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" target="_blank">`str.replace()`</a>. 

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-one">first</a> requirement, I reused the `browseBtn` in the starter code, 
which I mapped to a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qpushbutton.html" target="_blank">`QPushButton`</a> to react to the 
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qabstractbutton.html#clicked" target="_blank">`clicked()`</a> signal. I added one line to the `get_filepath()` 
function in order to set the display text of the corresponding <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html" target="_blank">`QLineEdit`</a> widget:

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.setText(self.filepath)
```

Since the second requirement was similar to that of the first, I set the second filepath to the target folder
with some reused code and variable names:

``` python
self.lineEditNewFolder.setText(self.new_folder)
```

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-three">third</a> requirement - and to validate incoming filepaths - I looked at the `QLineEdit` 
widget which held the value for the current folder. I wanted to handle the resulting value after clicking on the `browseBtn`, *and* 
the resulting value after editing the contents of the `QLineEdit` widget directly. I decided to:

1. Rename `get_filepath()` to `get_filepath_from_filedialog()`
2. Connect the `QLineEdit` widget's <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html#editingFinished" target="_blank">`editingFinished()`</a> signal 
   to a new slot named `get_filepath_from_lineedit()`
3. React whenever `self.filepath` was set to some value, with a new function named `check_filepath()`

Steps 2 and 3 are shown below:

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.editingFinished.connect(self.get_filepath_from_lineedit())
```
``` python
def get_filepath_from_lineedit(self):
    self.filepath = self.lineEditFilepath.text()
    self.check_filepath()
```

The `check_filepath()` function was responsible for checking if a recently set `filepath` pointed to a valid directory - if so, 
then the pending list of selected files (displayed via <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlistwidget.html" target="_blank">`QListWidget`</a>) 
would update with the help of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" target="_blank">`os.walk()`</a>:

``` python
def check_filepath(self):
    if os.path.isdir(self.filepath):
        self.update_list()
    else:
        # Log error to console

def update_list(self):
    """
    Clear listwidget
    read files in filepath with os.walk
    Add files as new items
    """
    self.listWidget.clear()
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.filepath):
        self.listWidget.addItems(files)
```
<p class="caption">*Code reused for the second widget which held the value for the target folder.</p>

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-four">fourth</a> and final requirement, I included two 
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qradiobutton.html" target="_blank">`QRadioButtons`</a> which were set to exclusive
mode by default, meaning that if one radio button were to be enabled, then the other would be disabled and vice versa.
Depending on which radio button was toggled on, an internal flag named `copy_files` would be set to true or false:

``` python
self.radioButtonRename.toggled.connect(self.set_copy_files)
self.radioButtonCopy.toggled.connect(self.set_copy_files)
```
``` python
def set_copy_files(self):
    """
    Toggle between rename/move files mode and copy files mode
    """
    if self.radioButtonRename.isChecked():
        self.copy_files = False
    elif self.radioButtonCopy.isChecked():
        self.copy_files = True
```

### Optional Features ###

As for the optional steps per operation, I relied on `os.path.splitext()` to get the extension per filename, in order to
filter on the `.png`, `.ma`, and `.txt` file extensions.

For the string replacement operation, I retrieved a space-delimited string from the corresponding `QLineEdit` widget, and 
called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" target="_blank">`str.split()`</a> to get an array of
strings to search for. I retrieved *one* replacement string from the other, corresponding `QLineEdit` widget, and looped over
the individual array elements in order to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" target="_blank">`str.replace()`</a>
with the new string:
``` python
def find_and_replace(files)
    """
    If the filename contains the string to find, 
    then replace with the new string
    """
    new_files = []
    for file in files:
        fname, ext = os.path.splitext(file)
        for s in self.strings_to_find:
            # replace with the new string
            fname = fname.replace(s, self.string_to_replace)
        new_file = fname + ext
        new_files.append(new_file)

    return new_files
```
For adding a prefix and/or suffix to each filename, an `os.path.splitext()` followed by a few string concatenations were sufficient.

For the overwrite flag, I found that the `toggled()` and `isChecked()` methods could be called upon a 
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qcheckbox.html" target="_blank">`QCheckBox`</a> in addition to the `QRadioButton`, as 
both Qt widgets inherit from the same <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qabstractbutton.html" target="_blank">`QAbstractButton`</a> class. 
So, I repurposed the existing code around the rename/copy flag, for reuse with the overwrite flag:

``` python
self.checkBoxOverwrite.toggled.connect(self.set_overwrite)
```

``` python
def set_overwrite(self):
    """
    Set the overwrite flag
    """
    self.overwrite = self.checkBoxOverwrite.isChecked()
```

### QoL Improvements ###

I had time to add some additional behavior to the batch renamer utility to make it easier to use. I gave the tool the ability to:

- Enable the "Run" button only if a valid starting filepath is set
- Clear (most) `QLineEdit` contents after each batch rename operation
- Support comma-delimited strings to search for and replace
- Collapse consecutive whitepace in the strings to search for, into a single space
 
The consecutive whitespace issue was addressed with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" target="_blank">`re.sub()`</a> and a 
regular expression for one or more whitespace characters, or `\s+`, as the pattern to match.

I also had time to grant the ability to log color-coded <mark style="background: yellow;">errors</mark> and <mark style="background: yellow;">warnings</mark>, as well as <mark style="background: lime;">successful</mark> rename operations, in the dialog itself in addition to logging to standard out.

However, one issue did arise as I worked on the logger behavior. I noticed that clicking, and then removing focus from a `QLineEdit` widget (by clicking
outside of the edit field) would trigger an extra warning. I decided to address this by detecting if the `QLineEdit` contents had changed between focus events, with 
help from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html#textChanged" target="_blank">`textChanged()`</a> signal.

I reworked the logger so that an <mark style="background: yellow;">"invalid filepath"</mark> warning would print 
under the condition that the current folder had changed. I connected the corresponding `QLineEdit` widget's `textChanged()` signal to a new slot 
which I named `update_filepath()`. Upon activation, the `update_filepath()` function would update an internal boolean flag to keep track of changes:

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.textChanged.connect(self.update_filepath)
```

``` python
def update_filepath(self):
    """
    Check if lineEdit text for the filepath has changed
    """
    if not self.filepath_changed:
        self.filepath_changed = True
```
