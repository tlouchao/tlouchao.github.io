## Background ##

From February 2024 to April 2024, I had the chance to take a [technical art course through ELVTR](https://elvtr.com/course/technical-art) - 
I had heard that the tech art role required some proficiency in Python programming, in addition to art sensibilities in the case of shaders and VFX. 

Before taking the course, I was acquainted with Python, but not within the context of games. And, I was unfamiliar with PyQt/[Qt for Python](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python).

### Batch Renamer Utility ###

A few weeks into the coursework, I was to implement a batch renamer utility - firstly as a command line script, and later on as a [PyQt6 application](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) built on top of the previous script.

The completed utility would help with consolidating hundreds (or thousands) of files from various owners/teams under some common naming convention, 
and provide the option to rename files in place or copy them to some destination folder. 

## The Dilemma ##

The utility was to do at least the following per rename operation:

1. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-one">Get a valid filepath to the current folder</a>
2. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-two">Get a valid filepath to a target folder</a>   
3. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-three">Select files in the current folder</a>          
4. <a class="anchor-nohover" name="requirement-four">Rename the selected files in place, or copy to the target folder</a>

Optionally, the utility could do one or more of the following steps per operation:
- Filter selected files by file extension
- Find and replace one or more substrings for each filename
- Add a *prefix* and/or *suffix* to each filename
- Enable overwriting the selected files (if the files already exist in the target folder)

Given the following test files, the output filenames were to be free of noise such as the version number of the file, 
or words such as "file", "final", et cetera. At the same time, each filename would have a short prefix and/or suffix to indicate the game asset type:
| Initial Filenames | Target |
|---|---|
|texture_metal_diffuse.png | T_metal_C.png
|grass_file_01.ma          | M_grass.ma
|hello_world.txt           | NOTE_hello_world_TEMP.txt

For example, the filename for a diffuse map could have a <mark>"T"</mark> prefix instead of "texture", and a 
<mark>"C"</mark> suffix instead of "diffuse" or "color".

## Tools and Setup ##
[Qt Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download) was introduced as a free tool for prototyping graphical user interfaces, with 
widgets from the Qt GUI framework (though the possibility remained open to build a GUI from scratch). 

A batch file was provided to convert the XML based `.ui` file from Qt Designer to an equivalent `.py` file, and map Qt widget 
names directly to the data attributes of a Python class named `Ui_MainWindow` when run:

``` shell
python -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -x batch_renamer.ui -o batch_renamer_ui.py
```
The `batch_renamer_ui.py` file would be included as a dependency in another file containing some starter code - below is an 
example of a button click event connected to an event handler. Or in Qt terms, a `clicked()` [signal](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html) 
connected to a [slot](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html):

``` python
# Our Qt Designer GUI as a Python class
from batch_renamer_ui import Ui_MainWindow

class BatchRenamerWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):

    def __init__(self):
            # UI Setup
            super().__init__()
            super(Ui_MainWindow).__init__()
            self.setupUi(self)
            # Connect button to a function
            # Make sure that there is a Qt Widget named "browseBtn"
            self.browseBtn.clicked.connect(self.get_filepath)

    def get_filepath(self):
        self.filepath = QFileDialog().getExistingDirectory()
```

## Implementation ##

As I was unfamiliar with PyQt beforehand, note that the following details will mostly cover discoveries made while working with PyQt.

### UI Design ###

After some initial prototyping in Qt Designer, I eventually landed on the GUI shown below, which I styled with a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/stylesheet.html" target="_blank">Qt Style Sheet</a> (credits to <a href="https://qss-stock.devsecstudio.com/templates.php" target="_blank">DevSec Studio</a>):

<BlogImage src={"/blog/2024_09_01_batch_renamer/batch_renamer_gui.png"} alt={"Batch Renamer Utility GUI"} width={720}/>

Now that I had a GUI, I needed to add in some functionality - I needed to handle user interaction with Qt's edit fields, buttons, and other clickable widgets. 

### Requirements ###

After familiarizing myself with the project files, I extended the starter code and leaned on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank">`os`</a> module for file navigation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path" target="_blank">`os.path`</a> for pathname manipulation, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re" target="_blank">`re`</a> for regular expression matching, as well as built-in string methods such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" target="_blank">`str.replace()`</a>. 

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-one">first</a> requirement, I reused the `browseBtn` in the starter code, 
which I mapped to a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qpushbutton.html" target="_blank">`QPushButton`</a> to react to the 
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qabstractbutton.html#clicked" target="_blank">`clicked()`</a> signal. I added one line to the `get_filepath()` 
function in order to set the display text of the corresponding <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html" target="_blank">`QLineEdit`</a> widget:

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.setText(self.filepath)
```

Since the second requirement was similar to that of the first, I set the second filepath to the target folder
with some reused code and variable names:

``` python
self.lineEditNewFolder.setText(self.new_folder)
```

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-three">third</a> requirement - and to validate incoming filepaths - I looked at the `QLineEdit` 
widget which held the value for the current folder. I wanted to handle the resulting value after clicking on the `browseBtn` to open the file dialog, *and* 
the resulting value after editing the contents of the `QLineEdit` widget directly. I decided to:

1. Connect the `QLineEdit` widget's <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html#editingFinished" target="_blank">`editingFinished()`</a> signal 
   to a new slot named `get_filepath_from_lineedit()`
2. React whenever `self.filepath` was set to some value, either through:
    - file dialog confirmation
    - the `QLineEdit` widget (direct edit)

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.editingFinished.connect(self.get_filepath_from_lineedit())
```
``` python
def get_filepath_from_lineedit(self):
    self.filepath = self.lineEditFilepath.text()
    self.check_filepath()
```

The `check_filepath()` function was responsible for checking if a recently set `filepath` pointed to a valid directory - if so, 
then the pending list of selected files (displayed via <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlistwidget.html" target="_blank">`QListWidget`</a>) 
would update with the help of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" target="_blank">`os.walk()`</a>:

``` python
def check_filepath(self):
    if os.path.isdir(self.filepath):
        self.update_list()
    else:
        # Log error to console

def update_list(self):
    """
    Clear listwidget
    read files in filepath with os.walk
    Add files as new items
    """
    self.listWidget.clear()
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.filepath):
        self.listWidget.addItems(files)
```

To fulfill the <a href="#requirement-four">fourth</a> and final requirement, I included two 
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qradiobutton.html" target="_blank">`QRadioButtons`</a> set to exclusive
mode (only one radio button can be enabled at a time).
Depending on which radio button was enabled, a flag named `copy_files` (checked when the utility is run) would be set to true/false:

``` python
self.radioButtonRename.toggled.connect(self.set_copy_files)
self.radioButtonCopy.toggled.connect(self.set_copy_files)
```
``` python
def set_copy_files(self):
    """
    Toggle between rename/move files mode and copy files mode
    """
    if self.radioButtonRename.isChecked():
        self.copy_files = False
    elif self.radioButtonCopy.isChecked():
        self.copy_files = True
```

### Optional Features ###

For the optional steps per operation, I relied on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" target="_blank">`os.path.splitext()`</a> to extract the extension from currently selected files and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" target="_blank">`str.split()`</a> on a space-delimited string from the 
corresponding `QLineEdit` widget to filter on `.png`, `.ma`, and `.txt` file extensions.

For the string replacement operation, I  called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" target="_blank">`str.split()`</a>
on a space-delimited string from the corresponding `QLineEdit` widget to get an array of strings to search for, and called 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" target="_blank">`str.replace()`</a> on each array element:
``` python
def find_and_replace(files)
    """
    If the filename contains the string to find, 
    then replace with the new string
    """
    new_files = []
    for file in files:
        fname, ext = os.path.splitext(file)
        for s in self.strings_to_find:
            # replace with the new string
            fname = fname.replace(s, self.string_to_replace)
        new_file = fname + ext
        new_files.append(new_file)

    return new_files
```
For adding a prefix and/or suffix to each filename, an `os.path.splitext()` followed by string concatenations were sufficient.

For the overwrite flag, I found that the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qcheckbox.html" target="_blank">`QCheckBox`</a> inherited the 
`toggled()` and `isChecked()` methods from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qabstractbutton.html" target="_blank">`QAbstractButton`</a> class. 
I reused the existing code for the rename/copy flag to handle the overwrite flag:

``` python
self.checkBoxOverwrite.toggled.connect(self.set_overwrite)
```

``` python
def set_overwrite(self):
    """
    Set the overwrite flag
    """
    self.overwrite = self.checkBoxOverwrite.isChecked()
```

### QoL Features ###

I wanted to make the batch renamer utility easier to use, and gave the tool the ability to:

- Enable the "Run" button only if a valid starting filepath is set
- Clear (most) `QLineEdit` contents after each batch rename operation
- Log color-coded errors (<mark style="background: yellow;">yellow</mark> for errors and warnings, <mark style="background: lime;">green</mark> for successful rename operations)
- Support comma-delimited strings to search for and replace
- Collapse consecutive whitespace in `QLineEdit` widgets into a single space (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" target="_blank">`re.sub()`</a>
for pattern matching and `\s+` as the pattern)

#### Bugfixes ####
I noticed that clicking, and then removing focus from a `QLineEdit` widget would trigger an extra warning. 
I addressed this by checking if the `QLineEdit` contents had changed between focus events, with 
help from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qlineedit.html#textChanged" target="_blank">`textChanged()`</a> signal.

``` python
self.lineEditFilepath.textChanged.connect(self.update_filepath)
```

``` python
def update_filepath(self):
    """
    Check if lineEdit text for the filepath has changed
    """
    if not self.filepath_changed:
        self.filepath_changed = True
```
